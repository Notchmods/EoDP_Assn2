Question: What are the differences in traffic accident outcomes among various vehicle types 
          under different road and environmental conditions?

- Please download data from https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data
  In this assignment, we are currently using these data file: 
    Accident, 
    Vehicle, 
    Atmospheric Condition, 
    Person
  If you reckon any other files could be included, pls discuss with all group members.

- For accident environments:
    We mainly focus on the following factor:
        - road geometry
        - light level
        - road surface
        - Atmospheric Condition

- For accident outcome:
    We mainly focus on the following factor:
        - vehicle damage level
        - number of people (driver or passenger) injured from the accident
            Notes: There are counts for diffrent level of injury. 
        - average injury level across driver and all passengers

Some Questions I'm not sure:
- number of people (driver or passenger) injured VS. average injury level
    There two are basically same things. I think you only need to use one of them to reflect the 
    safety of the car under a certain condition. Considering which one to use, I think just choose
    the one better/easier for your task. The reason I kept both is just providing your another 
    option (hopefully is helpful to you)

- How should we measure the outcome of an accident?
    Just my opinion, we could analyze how structurally vulnerable or robust the vehicle is (i.e., how 
    easily it gets damaged or the structural integrity). Another use of damage level could be a 
    factor to reflect the servity of the accidents. I think the correlation between damage level and 
    injury under different condition could tell us something.

- Frequency:
    I didn't do anything with the frequency counts (sorry for that). It should be very easy. I think 
    it's better to have that as well. It could answer some questions like "Which type of vehicle is 
    more dangerous when there is no light?"

A few possible problems we could solve:
- How does road geometry influence accident severity across different vehicle types?
- Do different light conditions (e.g., day, night, dusk) impact injury severity differently across vehicle types?
- Which vehicle types are more prone to severe outcomes on poor road surfaces (e.g., gravel, unpaved)?
- Under adverse weather (e.g., heavy rain, fog), which vehicle types experience the highest increase in fatality rate?
- Are rear-seat passengers more vulnerable in certain vehicle types (e.g., Light Commercial vs. Passenger Cars)?
- Are some vehicle types consistently more dangerous for front-seat passengers?
- Does higher vehicle damage always correlate with higher injury levels? Does this vary by vehicle type?
- Are there vehicles with high structural damage but surprisingly low passenger injuriesâ€”or the opposite?
- Are there specific combinations of conditions (e.g., night + wet road + motorcycle) that result in extreme injury outcomes?
- Are some vehicle types generally safer regardless of road and environmental conditions?
- Does the number of occupants in a vehicle influence the injury outcome? For example, are rear-seat injuries worse when more people are seated?
